    <DIV CLASS="COL-SM-9 TEXT-CENTER">
        <P>CLOUD-ENABLED INDUSTRIAL SMART VEHICLES ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY PREVALENT IN THE MODERN WORLD, WHERE THEY ARE USED FOR A WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, AND MANUFACTURING. THESE VEHICLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH VARIOUS SENSORS AND DEVICES THAT ALLOW THEM TO COLLECT AND PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA, MAKING THEM AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS (IIOT). HOWEVER, AS WITH ANY INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICE, THE SECURITY OF CLOUD-ENABLED INDUSTRIAL SMART VEHICLES IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN.
ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECTS OF SECURITY IS ACCESS CONTROL, WHICH IS THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING WHO IS ALLOWED TO ACCESS A RESOURCE AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. TRADITIONAL ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS, SUCH AS ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL, ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR CLOUD-ENABLED INDUSTRIAL SMART VEHICLES, AS THEY LACK THE FLEXIBILITY AND GRANULARITY REQUIRED TO MANAGE ACCESS IN A DYNAMIC AND HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT.
 </P>
        <P>ATTRIBUTE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (ABAC) IS A MORE FLEXIBLE AND DYNAMIC APPROACH TO ACCESS CONTROL THAT ALLOWS ACCESS DECISIONS TO BE MADE BASED ON ATTRIBUTES OF USERS, RESOURCES, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. ABAC IS A POPULAR ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISM IN THE CLOUD COMPUTING DOMAIN AND HAS BEEN APPLIED TO VARIOUS OTHER DOMAINS SUCH AS HEALTHCARE, FINANCE, AND E-COMMERCE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF RESEARCH ON THE APPLICATION OF ABAC IN CLOUD-ENABLED INDUSTRIAL SMART VEHICLES.
IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN ABAC MODEL FOR CLOUD-ENABLED INDUSTRIAL SMART VEHICLES THAT CONSIDERS CONTEXT-AWARENESS AND MULTI-LEVEL ACCESS CONTROL. THE PROPOSED MODEL IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SECURE AND EFFICIENT ACCESS CONTROL IN A DYNAMIC AND HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENT.
